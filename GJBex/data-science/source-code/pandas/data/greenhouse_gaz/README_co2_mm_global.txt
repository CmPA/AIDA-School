# USE OF NOAA ESRL DATA
#
# These data are made freely available to the public and the
# scientific community in the belief that their wide dissemination
# will lead to greater understanding and new scientific insights.
# The availability of these data does not constitute publication
# of the data.  NOAA relies on the ethics and integrity of the user to
# insure that ESRL receives fair credit for their work.  If the data
# are obtained for potential use in a publication or presentation,
# ESRL should be informed at the outset of the nature of this work.
# If the ESRL data are essential to the work, or if an important
# result or conclusion depends on the ESRL data, co-authorship
# may be appropriate.  This should be discussed at an early stage in
# the work.  Manuscripts using the ESRL data should be sent to ESRL
# for review before they are submitted for publication so we can
# insure that the quality and limitations of the data are accurately
# represented.

# RECIPROCITY
#
# Use of these data implies an agreement to reciprocate.
# Laboratories making similar measurements agree to make their
# own data available to the general public and to the scientific
# community in an equally complete and easily accessible form.
# Modelers are encouraged to make available to the community,
# upon request, their own tools used in the interpretation
# of the ESRL data, namely well documented model code, transport
# fields, and additional information necessary for other
# scientists to repeat the work and to run modified versions.
# Model availability includes collaborative support for new
# users of the models.

# The uncertainty in the global monthly mean is estimated using a
# a monte carlo technique that computes 100 globally-averaged time
# series, each time using a slightly different set of measurement
# records from the NOAA ESRL cooperative air sampling network.  The
# reported uncertainty, 0.13 ppm, is the mean of the standard deviations
# for each monthly mean using this technique.  Please see Conway et al.,
# 1994, JGR, vol. 99, no. D11. for a complete discussion.  Units are ppm.

# CO2 expressed as a mole fraction in dry air, micromol/mol, abbreviated as ppm
#
# NOTE: In general, the data presented for the last year are subject to change,
# depending on recalibration of the reference gas mixtures used, and other quality
# control procedures. Occasionally, earlier years may also be changed for the same
# reasons.  Usually these changes are minor.
