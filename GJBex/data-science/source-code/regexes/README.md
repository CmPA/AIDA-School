# Regexes

Regular expressionn are a formalism to describe sets of strings. They
can be used to check whether a string matches a given pattern, for
exstracting parts of strings, or substituting part of strings in a
way that is much more powerful and flexible than the `str` methods
for those purposes.

## What is it?
1. `regexes.ipynb`: Jupiter notebook illustrating various aspects of
    using regular expressions in string-related tasks.  This conveys
    the flavor, rather than being a comprehensive introduction.

More information on regular expressions can be found in the Python
introduction slides.
