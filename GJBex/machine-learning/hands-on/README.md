# Notebooks

All notebooks come in at least two versions:
  
  * `lazy`: all code is ready to execute, doesn't contain output; and
  * `complete`: intended to be viewed on Github, does contain output.

For some notebooks, there is a `courageous` version as well, which means
that you will have to write some of the code yourself.

1. 010_underfitting_overfitting:
    illustrates the concepts of underfitting and and overfitting using
    non-linear regression.
1. 020_mnist_data_exploration_complete:
    exploring the MNIST data set (complete notebook with output).
1 030_activation_function:
    visualization of the relevant activation functions.
1. 040_mnist_mlp:
    illustrates data pipelines and construction of a classic multilayer
    perceptron to recognize handwritten digits.
1. 050_convolution:
    illustrates convolution as used in convolutional neural networks.
1. 060_mnist_cnn:
    illustrates a convolutional neural network to recognize handwritten
    digits.
1. 070_imdb_data_exploration: exploring the IMDB data set.
1. 080_imdb_rnn:
    illustrates recurrent neural networks using GRU and LSTM units for
    sentiment classification on the IMDB data set.
