The Python programming language is increasingly popular.  It is a
versatile language for general purpose programming and accessible
for novice programmers.  However, it is also the de facto go-to
language for machine learning applciations.  This training
introduces modules that are useful in that context.


## Learning outcomes

When you complete this training you will

  * understand what supervised and unsupervised learning are;
  * understand the workflow required for supervised learning;
  * be able to implement that workflow in scikit-learn;
  * know how to use algorithms in scikit-learn such as ridge regression
    and naive Bayes classification;
  * be able to apply k-means clustering;
  * understand the main concepts in deep neural networks;
  * be able to apply a convolutional neural network (CNN) to an image
    classification task;
  * understand the concepts underpinning word embeddings;
  * be able to use recurrent network architectures such as 
    long short term memory (LSTM) to natural language problems;
  * be aware of best practices and pitfalls in machine learning.

## Training materials

Slides are available in the
 [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gjbex/Python-for-machine-learning),
as well as example code and hands-on material.


## Target audience

This training is for you if you need to use Python for machine learning
pplcations.


## Prerequisites

You will need experience programming in Python.  This is not a training that starts
from scratch.  Familiarity with numpy is not required, but would be beneficial.
Familiarity with numpy, pandas and matplotlib is strongly recommended.

If you plan to do Python programming in a Linux or HPC environment you should
be familiar with these as well.
